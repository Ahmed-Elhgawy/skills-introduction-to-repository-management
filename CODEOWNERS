## Need help or have ideas?

- Check the open issues first.
  - If your problem is there, add a comment or up-vote.
  - If not there, create a new issue. Be as descriptive as possible.
- Ask in our weekly IT Club office hours (Thursdays at lunch in Room 203).
- For other general problems, email the tech team at techclub@mergingtonhigh.example.edu
